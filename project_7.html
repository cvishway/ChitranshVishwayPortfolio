					The primary objective of this project is to design a controller which would improve the	efficiency of the gantry crane system. <b>Closed loops system </b> monitors the output and compare it to the input. If an error is detected, the system corrects the output and therefore corrects the effects of disturbances.
					Controllers were designed to improve the efficiency of the crane system. To do this, sensors that measure and adjust the input/outputs, such as transducers, transmitters, and detectors could be incorporated in the Gantry system to create a closed loop system. <b>Sensory feedback </b>is sent back to the controller, which in return adjusts the signal sent to the Trolley movement system to determine the displacement of the load. Implementing a closed loop system yields a higher accuracy in the displacement of the load since sensory input adjusts the behavior of the system. <b>The equations of motion</b> of the Load and Trolley were determined. A <b>Free Body Diagram (FBD)</b> was created to model the forces. The model was simulated in which the relationship between angular displacement of the load versus time was shown. The amplitude of each successful wave decreases by approximately 40%. Over the span of 100 seconds, the angular displacement decreased by almost 300%. Thus, it can be concluded that the system is truly stabilizing over time and the	swaying of the load is decreasing.
					<br><br>
					
					The Laplace transfer function relating the angular displacement of the load to the horizontal displacement was determined. Similarly, the transfer function relating the angular displacement of the load to the horizontal velocity of	the trolley was also found. It is shown that both transfer functions will have two poles
					since they are second degree polynomials. A <b>Simulink model</b> was created by using the transfer function obtained. From the models it was observed that the open loop system has a significant amount of error associated with. Since the final	output is far away from the what was inputted into the system. Plus, it
					also suggest that in the physical system there are discrepancy between the input and the output. Thus
					a <b>PID controller </b> is introduced to the <b>negative-unity feedback system</b> between the sum block and the 24 transfer function. So, the error can be rerouted to the PID controller and the correct output is signaled to the <b>transfer function</b>. The design of the PID Controller was done via <b>root-locus </b> and using the Sisotool in <b>MATLAB</b>.  The PID controller function was calculated and adjustments were made on sisotool until the desired settling time and overshoot percentage was	reached.
