			<h6>Skills Improved: <b>Product Design, Mechanical & Electrical Design, Solidworks, Manufacture, User Groups</b> </h6>
			<br>
			<p2>
				The EZ Car Tire Changing Kit was designed to meet the needs of users that may have had
				difficulty operating the reference design. To make the best product on the market, the EZ Car
				Tire Changing Kit had to target the three main issues with the current tire changing methods. To
				change a tire the user must first lift the car then remove the lug nuts off the tire, then remove the
				tire itself. The EZ Car Tire Changing Kit was not only better than the reference design at this
				operation but, the best in the market as it also accounts for portability, functionality,
				efficientancy, user-friendliness and the safety of its users.
				<br><br>
				The first task the user needed to do was lifting up the car. A standard jack requires the user to
				exert large amounts of physical force while being in a low position. This is ergonomically hard
				on the user as it forces them into uncomfortable positions for the entirety of the task. The Foot
				Operated Hydraulic Piston was designed to perform the functions of a car jack while allowing
				the user to stand. Once the piston had been positioned under the car, the user stands up and
				cranks the foot paddle on the piston. The pumping motion allows the hydraulic fluid in the piston
				to push the connecting rod in the upwards direction allowing the car to be lifted. After the car tire
				had been changed, the user simply has to step on the pressure release button on the piston to
				bring the car down. This design was also deemed to be safer, as there are no moving parts with
				cavities in them. On a scissor lift for example, there are many open areas where a finger could
				go in and due to a mechanical failure, injure the user. The piston does not allow for such
				possibilities, hence making it safer design to lift the car.
				<br><br>
				The second task after lifting the car was removing the lug nuts. A standard lug wrench requires
				the user to exert a considerable amount of force multiple times. This proves to be a difficult task
				for any user with injuries, muscular dystrophy or tremors. Furthermore, any user inadequately
				dressed would be unable to perform this task.The Semi-Automatic Drill solved this problem as it
				only requires the user to fasten the sockets onto the lug nuts, then simply perform the rest with
				a remote. The remote allows the user to perform three main operations; screw or unscrew the
				lug nuts, secondly based on the tire type, change the diameter between the sockets, and third
				stop the drill using the <i>Emergency Stop</i> button. This allows the user to operate the drill without
				compromising their safety and at the same time providing a user-friendly product. One of the
				main requirements was to have some automatic or semi-automatic components to aid users.
				The third task which may be difficult for the user was the removal of the tire from the tire shaft.
				Removing the tire requires the user to be bent over in a position that applies extreme levels of
				strain on their backs. Moreover, tires can be quite heavy for certain users or in some cases
				impossible to lift on their own. For these reasons, the dolly was designed to aid the user. The
				dolly simply rolls under the lifted tire, knocks it off the axle with a simple tilt, and gather the tire
				with ease.
				<br><br>		
				Our design can be attached and stored together to avoid losing parts and at the same time
				reduce the storage capacity. Cargo space is a large priority for many users, thus, creating a
				compact design was an important design criteria. The semi automatic drill connects to the front
				of our dolly with heavy weight velcro, while the piston latches onto the back of the dolly. The
				sinking of the handle to reduce the height of th dolly along with the foldable hooks make the
				dolly compact. This design feature allows all the components of the kit to be paired together
				while staying in one compact spot in the userâ€™s car. Instead of being in one large box like our
				reference design, being connected but exposed allows the user to disassemble it in the car.
				This is relevant as the user will never have to carry the full weight of the kit at once. Instead,
				they can take it apart and just carry one component at a time.
				<br><br>
				Other features were added to our kit to make it truly stand out. The most important being the
				semi-automatic drill with magnetic sockets and its ability to change the diameter between the
				sockets. By having the sockets on a groove connected to a belt, the distance between the
				socket and the center of the drill can be varied. The magnetic sockets eliminates the possibility
				of losing the lug nuts during the tire changing process. These features allow for an adaptable
				and user-friendly product.
				<br><br>
				The dolly has bright colored reflective tape. This allows the dolly to be seen by oncoming traffic,
				similar to a reflective vest. Most of the components are made using rubber and aluminium which
				decreases the chances of rust. Additionally, the entire kit has sacrificial anodes applied to
				prevent rust. The dolly also has rubber treaded wheels which allow the dolly to be used on
				multiple terrains. Lastly, the dolly is sturdy enough to be used for other activities as well in the
				users day to day life.
				<br><br>
				What really made this design stand out compared to other embodiments was the fact that it
				performed the same function as our number 2 and 3 spots, but better. This final design was the
				safest and resulted in the user being in the least compromising positions, baring the least
				amount of weight and using the least force. This final design is the most functional and efficient
				way concept which reflected upon our groups requirements as stated on page 32.
				The estimated cost of the overall product has been found to be roughly $147.03 as seen in
				Appendix 4, Table 15.0. However, with further manufacturing discounts this price is estimated to
				drop by around 20%, resulting in an overall price of roughly $120. Cost is expected to drop as
				larger quantities of materials are bought. Given the complexity of all the tools found within the
				kit, this price is found to be reasonable and affordable given that the kit provides the users with
				practical tools that may be used with several daily tasks. For example, the dolly is designed in
				such a way that it can be used as a daily tool for the user. The product strategy has stated that
				the goal cost was to be around $70, however, given the electrical and semi-automatic
				components being essential for all personas, this price limit was found to be unreasonable.
