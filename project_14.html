				A vapor cycle was designed to provide 29MW of power to sustain a population of approximately 18100 people. The ideal Rankine cycle was altered to extract 30.4MW of heat from a geothermal source available at 180°C at pressure 15.55 bar with flow rate 113.95 kg/s. A coal operated boiler provided an additional heat of 103.9 MW to provide the energy output through a three stage turbine with first stage reheat and second stage separation to an open 	feedwater heater. The turbine and pump were assumed to operate at 50% and 75% efficiency, respectively. The flow rate of the working fluid was calculated to be 45.11 kg/s through the first stage of the turbine and 39.6% of the flow rate was diverted into the open feedwater heater operating at 0.3 MPa. The highest temperature within the vapor cycle was calculated to be 480°C at 8MPa found at the inlet of the first stage of the turbine. The lowest temperature was calculated to be 41.5 °C at 0.008 MPa found at the exit of the third stage turbine. The thermal efficiency of the vapor cycle was determined to be 27.9% which is in acceptance with the efficiencies of			Rankine cycle found in real life power plants.
