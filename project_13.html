				The design roadmap approach led us to design a functional, manufacturable, and durable car
				which encompasses all features to complete the challenges of the competition. Firstly, the slim
				frame is a mixture of of the Controller Shaped Frame and the U-Frame which provides strength
				and functionality to the car. The sleek edges and smooth surface at the top of the frame allow air
				to glide over the car and minimize any drag. A circular bottom ensures that the car does not get
				stuck on the edges of the ramp and reduces the overall weight of the car.

				<br><br>
				The power system is comprised of two rubber bands which are stretched from hook-to-hook. The
				torsional strength of the rubber bands is larger than their tensile strength, thus, the crown gear
				configuration was used. Gears are meshed perpendicularly to translate the potential energy of the
				rubber bands into kinetic energy for the axle. For added functionality and usability, 5 different
				sizes of driving gears can be used to adjust for ideal speed or torque as our driving hub is
				comprised of 5 holes. For larger speeds, a bigger driving gear is attached in the car to drive a
				fixed driven gear on the axle and vice versa for torque. Upon experimentation, it was determined
				that if the ratio between the driving gear to driven gear is 1.5 to 1, the car is most functional in
				completing the challenges of the competition. The unique flexibility of our model allowed us to
				try out many different gear ratios before selecting the ideal one to maximize the functionality of
				our car. Similarly, three different holes to support the fixed hook at the front of the car allow us
				to adjust the linearity of the rubber bands across the two hooks. The fixed hook in the front of the
				car can be moved around from the center if the last holes of the driving gear hub were used.
				The four wheels design adds to the durability and functionality of the car. The two bigger wheels
				at the rear end of the car are connected to an axle which are powered by the power system, thus,
				the 2 wheel drive concept was used. As a result, the front two wheels act as stabilizers and are
				used to ensure that the car drives in a straight line. The decision to not power these two front
				21 wheels was made based on the merit that this would add extra weight to the car and since the pair
				of wheels have different diameters, another system would need to be introduced to match the
				RPM of both the pair of wheels. The larger gears also add weight to the back of the car which
				helps to add traction between the wheels and the floor. Additionally, we wrapped elastic bands
				around the back wheels to achieve the maximum amount of traction between the wheels and the
				floor. Without the rubber on the wheels, the amount of power that comes from the twisted elastic
				causes the wheels to spin out without the car going anywhere.
				<br><br>
				On a manufacturable perspective, the parts of our car are relatively easy for a CNC to machine.
				This was the most important criteria of our project because no matter how great the functionality
				of the car was, it needed to be manufactured and assembled. Other than the frame, all the other
				parts are very standard and composed of simple shapes. Super glue was used as our initial
				experimentation with 3D printed parts showed that super glue is very effective in bringing parts
				together. It is also the lightest way to mesh two parts together while ensuring durability and
				functionality. For this reason, we decided not to incorporate any nuts and bolts as they are
				heavier than glue and when tightened can initiate cracks within the acrylic.
				<br><br>
				We also made out car very user friendly and easily engageable. By twisting the wheels, the
				rubber bands begin to twist and gain potential energy. Since we are twisting torsionally, it
				requires less time to set up the car compared to stretching the rubber bands in the tensile
				direction. The large 3 inch wheels allow for an easy twisting motion.
				<br><br>
				The shape of our car turned out to be similar to an actual car and we believe that this reflects the
				successful design approach we took to tackle this project. Modern car designs are itierated every
				day by engineers to improve functionality, durability, manufacturability, and usability. The
				design roadmap approach led us to design a car with a shape similar to a modern car, suggesting
				that the steps we took to tackle the design of our project are similar to the design iterations that
				engineers take in real life.
