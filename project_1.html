				Team Haptic Solutions attempted to develop a mechatronics system involving a <b>LIDAR
				sensor </b> mounted on a robot which is remotely controlled via haptic feedback. Fires in large
				spaces, such as warehouses, create debris and obstacles for UGVs (Unmanned Ground Vehicles)
				to survey. This debris can be in the form of merchandise or structural components such as bricks
				or pipes. The objective of the project was to create a robot which can maneuver in large spaces
				engulfed by fire (low visibility environments) via haptic feedback. To do so, a revolving LIDAR
				sensor would be used to transmit its reading remotely to a controller which provides vibrational
				feedback to an operator to alert the presence of an obstacle in that direction. <b>The team was able
				to complete the following: manufacture the framework of the robot and haptic controller,
				wirelessly control the robot, and provide vibrational feedback to the operator based on the
				LIDAR readings. </b>This was done via carrying out a thorough design process of prototyping which
				included software iterations in <b>Python & C </b> and mechanical design iterations using <b>Solidworks</b>.
				The mechatronics system was created using <b>Raspberry Pi, Arduino, DC Motors, vibrational
				motors and LIDAR sensor. </b> The team conducted: literature review on existing solutions, created
				user groups and design criteria, and performed a DMFA Assessment to evaluate the feasibility of
				the system. However, due to the COVID-19 crisis that struck in March of 2020, the team was not able to put all systems
				together for design testing.
