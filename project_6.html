				EasyDishwasher is a modern dishwasher which elevates to waist height and is accessible from the countertop. A traditional dishwasher’s below-the-countertop opening strains the back of the user, thus, making is inaccessible for senior citizens, people with back injuries, or individuals who are tall. Along with its displeasing aesthetic, traditional dishwashers take up a lot of space and utilize 6-7 gallons of water per wash. On the contrary, EasyDishwasher raises itself to counter height and allows the user to load the dishes in a motion similar to placing a dish in a sink. The user interface allows the user to set a desired height of the dish rack and an easy slide-on lid, to cover the dishwasher when activated, commences the dishwashing process. EasyDishwasher reduces water usage by relying on the pressure of the water created by upgraded water jets to clean the dishes. Altogether, with a remote or a mobile app, the EasyDishwasher can be controlled without the attendance of the user in its vicinity. With an item so common in households, this modern dishwasher will reinvent the dishwashing experience.

				The EasyDishwasher is a modernized and improved version of a traditional dishwasher. A machine is required to wash dishes because it is more efficient and reduces human effort. However, the logistics behind a dishwasher has not changed since 1886, when Josephine Cochran patented a hollow rectangular compartment completed with a dish rack and a functional plumbing system. With this configuration, the user has to bend down to access the dishwasher and they are not optimal for small-space living. Currently, there are no market alternatives to increase the accessibility of the dishwasher and conserve space as they all have a rack that extends outwards into the user’s direction. Additionally, these dishwashers are expensive and use about 6-7 gallons of water per wash. In USA, 8 million dishwashers were shipped last year [1], and with an average cost of $400, the market can be estimated to be about a 3.2-billion-dollar/annually industry. Customers will choose EasyDishwasher because of its added accessibility and design. The convenience of loading dishes while standing reduces human effort when interacting with the machine. Lastly, the smooth aesthetics of the EasyDishwasher make it visually attractive to the eye. We tend to decorate our living space with colors that create a home-like feeling, as a result, the smooth finish of the EasyDishwasher along with many custom colors allows the user to decorate their kitchen accordingly.
