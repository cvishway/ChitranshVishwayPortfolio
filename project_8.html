			<h6>Skills Improved: <b>Robotics,Mechanical Design, Forces and Stress, Composition of Material, Product Design</b> </h6>

				This project consisted of designing a gearbox that drives an electric drive cart that has a finite life of 500-800 km of the carts operation. Some of the constraints that were given include positioning 75% of the overall load of 250 kg is transferred to the two-wheel axis and having a failure due to one of the gearbox shafts that break inside the gearbox. The final design was created by <b>conducting research</b> about drive carts in the current market, following the design process and backing up the final concept design with the calculations of the <b>forces, moments and stresses </b> on the shaft and ultimately the life of the shaft within the gearbox before failure. After computing the life of the shaft, it yielded 1,126,000 cycles before failure, or approximately 601 km of the carts operation. For most of the mathematical analysis of the shaft and the gearbox, <b>MATLAB</b> was utilized due to its convenience and further aided the team acquire the desired values to meet the constraints and requirements. After the final concept was generated through the design process and mathematically analyzed, multiple CAD drawings were made in <b>SolidWorks.</b> These CAD drawings include the assembled cart, the shaft and the gearbox; it also includes other parts that were required to assemble the cart.

				Using tabular data, three main types of SAE steel grades are chosen, AISI 1020, AISI
				1030, and AISI 1040. Two main considerations will be used in picking the steel grade,
				the diameter of the shaft, and the cost of the steel. Ideally, the smallest diameter, and
				the cheapest costing steel should be used to optimize for cost. The general shape of the
				shaft is chosen to determine the most critical point which is the location with the highest
				concentration of stress. However, the only designable component of the cart is the
				diameter and material of the shaft. This is due to the restraints and requirements that
				force the shaft to be under both the forces of the load and weight of the cart, and the
				torque of the motor.Using the <b>DE-Goodman criteria </b>, and
				the known forces and stresses, a rough estimate of the shaft diameter is found. This initial shaft diameter calculated is used as an initial guess in the
				iterative process to find the best shaft diameter. The next step of the calculation is
				shown uses <b>von Mises </b> stress is used along with the Goodman criteria.
				These calculations of shaft diameter should yield a value of n less than 1, to prove that the shaft
				has a finite life. Knowing the specifications of the gears, and the size of the wheels, the
				number of cycles the shaft can handle is calculated.
				The logic behind these calculations is that for each single rotation of the shaft, the
				wheels rotate once, corresponding to a distance travelled equal to the perimeter of the
				wheels. From this perimeter length, the desired distance of 500-800 km can be divided
				to find the number of shaft cycles. The final value of the shaft has a diameter of
				0.0247m and a lifespan of between roughly 1.126 million cycles or 601 km of usage.
				The specific size of the wheels are chosen to be 17 cm pneumatic wheels as taken from where the bearings are removed for the driven axle.
				<br><br>
				The power produced by the 12 HP motor causes the shaft connected to the motor to
				rotate at a really high Rpm but with very low torque. Thus, it becomes essential to
				convert the low torque into high torque via a gear set. The gear set is in encased in a
				gearbox which consists of 2 spurs gears with 20 degree pressure angle. The gears
				were chosen to be spurs gears with 20 degree pressure angle because its cheap to
				manufacture and maintain. Since the input speed (450 rpm) is 2.95 times greater
				than the output speed (153 rpm). The gear ratio for this design becomes 1/2.95 where
				the bigger gear is 2.95 times greater than the small gear. In the case of this design the
				small gear was calculated to have a pitch diameter of 3 cm and 13 tooth. Whereas the
				bigger gear was calculated to have a pitch diameter of 8.8 cm and 38 tooth. This unique
				gear set ensures that the low torque of 190 Nm gets amplified and becomes 558 Nm.
				Furthermore, this gear set also ensures that the cart moves at 5km/h or 153 rpm with 17
				cm wheel diameter.
