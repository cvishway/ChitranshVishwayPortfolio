				The purpose of the rack and pinion linear tracker is to be able to emulate the autonomous
				movement of a linear fume tracker. It does so by using a <b>Sharp IR sensor (Block A) </b>to measure
				the distance between itself, and the user controlled secondary piece (Block B). The system works
				by receiving signals from the distance sensor, then relaying those values to <b>LabVIEW</b>; where it
				proceeds to calculate the position error and energizes the motor to translate the position of the rack.
				Block B had a range of ±5cm and was made of a black piece of paper glued onto a rail system.
				The micrometal gear motor has a torque of 260 μNm as specified by the manufacturer, and it was
				observed that only 76.1 μNm of torque was required to move the rack. The final results exhibited
				the following values for the various errors present in the calibration of the system. These errors
				were found based on the data collected from the <b>calibration of the final design</b>, all of which have
				a full scale of 3 V. The non-linearity error was found to be ±0.0045 V , which was 0.3% Full Scale
				Output (FSO). A zero offset error of ±0.265 V, being 17.67% of the FSO; the repeatability error
				was found to be ±0.005 V, being 0.33% of the FSO. Hysteresis error of ±0.01V being 0.66% of
				the FSO. The rise time of the dynamic response was found to be 17 ms, and a settling time of 8
				ms. The system settles at approximately 10.01 cm at steady state. These values were collected
				using the <b>LabVIEW VI</b>, and in conjunction with excel, appropriate values were calculated and
				recorded. CAD drawings were produced using <b>Solidworks.</b>
