					The aim of this project was to create a gripper mechanism that could hold a 500-gram cup of maximum diameter of 8.0 cm. The gripper mechanism had to be designed in such a way that it did not exceed the dimensions of 150mm x 250mm x 200mm in use. To design such a gripper, variables such as the coefficient of friction of the gripping materials, forces acting on the cup and, the torque required by the motor were determined. Polyurethane was the chosen material for the gripping application since it has a high coefficient of friction and can generate a frictional force greater than or equal to the weight if the cup, which was 4.9 N. 
					Mathematical calculations were done on the design to see if the power required to move the gripping mechanism matched with the input power provided by the motor. 
					A model of the design was created in <b>Solidworks.</b> Few other mechanical properties that were implemented were: <b> gear design, motor-output, four-bar configuration, and torque. </b>
					Overall, the mechanism that was designed is approximate 11cm x 10cm x 5cm and is comprised of 13 different components that are made from polycarbonates, AISI Steels, Aluminum, Plastics and Polyurethane. The mechanism can successfully grasp cups within the range of [0.5,8]cm in diameter. The unique symmetrical design provides added stability during the usage of the mechanism â€“ as the center of gravity is relatively in the center of the mechanism.
